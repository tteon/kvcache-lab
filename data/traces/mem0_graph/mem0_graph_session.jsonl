The response should be in json with a key as \"facts\" and corresponding value will be a list of strings.\n- You should detect the language of the user input and record the facts in the same language.\n\nFollowing is a conversation between the user and the assistant. You have to extract the relevant facts and preferences about the user, if any, from the conversation and return them in the json format as shown above.\n\nuser: Input:\nuser: Netflix was founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997 as a DVD rental service.

{"timestamp": 1772231790938413, "input": "system: \nYou are a graph memory manager specializing in identifying, managing, and optimizing relationships within graph-based memories. Your primary task is to analyze a list of existing relationships and determine which ones should be deleted based on the new information provided.\nInput:\n1. Existing Graph Memories: A list of current graph memories, each containing source, relationship, and destination information.\n2. New Text: The new information to be integrated into the existing graph structure.\n3. Use \"user_id: trace_user\" as node for any self-references (e.g., \"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.) in user messages.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Identification: Use the new information to evaluate existing relationships in the memory graph.\n2. Deletion Criteria: Delete a relationship only if it meets at least one of these conditions:\n   - Outdated or Inaccurate: The new information is more recent or accurate.\n   - Contradictory: The new information conflicts with or negates the existing information.\n3. DO NOT DELETE if their is a possibility of same type of relationship but different destination nodes.\n4. Comprehensive Analysis:\n   - Thoroughly examine each existing relationship against the new information and delete as necessary.\n   - Multiple deletions may be required based on the new information.\n5. Semantic Integrity:\n   - Ensure that deletions maintain or improve the overall semantic structure of the graph.\n   - Avoid deleting relationships that are NOT contradictory/outdated to the new information.\n6. Temporal Awareness: Prioritize recency when timestamps are available.\n7. Necessity Principle: Only DELETE relationships that must be deleted and are contradictory/outdated to the new information to maintain an accurate and coherent memory graph.\n\nNote: DO NOT DELETE if their is a possibility of same type of relationship but different destination nodes. \n\nFor example: \nExisting Memory: alice -- loves_to_eat -- pizza\nNew Information: Alice also loves to eat burger.\n\nDo not delete in the above example because there is a possibility that Alice loves to eat both pizza and burger.\n\nMemory Format:\nsource -- relationship -- destination\n\nProvide a list of deletion instructions, each specifying the relationship to be deleted.\n\nuser: Here are the existing memories: google -- founded_in -- 1998\niphone -- released_in -- june_2007\namazon_web_services -- launched -- 2004\ntwitter -- acquired_for -- $44_billion\n2024 -- is_tournament_of -- fifa_world_cup\n5_billion_viewers -- is_estimated_viewership_of -- 2024\nqatar -- is_host_country_of -- 2024\ngoogle -- processed_queries_by -- 2024 \n\n New Information: Netflix was founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997 as a DVD rental service.
