New Text: The new information to be integrated into the existing graph structure.\n3. Use \"user_id: trace_user\" as node for any self-references (e.g., \"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.) in user messages.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Identification: Use the new information to evaluate existing relationships in the memory graph.\n2. Deletion Criteria: Delete a relationship only if it meets at least one of these conditions:\n   - Outdated or Inaccurate: The new information is more recent or accurate.\n   - Contradictory: The new information conflicts with or negates the existing information.\n3. DO NOT DELETE if their is a possibility of same type of relationship but different destination nodes.\n4. Comprehensive Analysis:\n   - Thoroughly examine each existing relationship against the new information and delete as necessary.\n   - Multiple deletions may be required based on the new information.\n5. Semantic Integrity:\n   - Ensure that deletions maintain or improve the overall semantic structure of the graph.\n   - Avoid deleting relationships that are NOT contradictory/outdated to the new information.\n6. Temporal Awareness: Prioritize recency when timestamps are available.\n7. Necessity Principle: Only DELETE relationships that must be deleted and are contradictory/outdated to the new information to maintain an accurate and coherent memory graph.\n\nNote: DO NOT DELETE if their is a possibility of same type of relationship but different destination nodes. \n\nFor example: \nExisting Memory: alice -- loves_to_eat -- pizza\nNew Information: Alice also loves to eat burger.\n\nDo not delete in the above example because there is a possibility that Alice loves to eat both pizza and burger.\n\nMemory Format:\nsource -- relationship -- destination\n\nProvide a list of deletion instructions, each specifying the relationship to be deleted.\n\nuser: Here are the existing memories: spacex -- developed -- dragon_spacecraft\nspacex -- developed -- falcon_9\nspacex -- founded_by -- elon_musk\nelon_musk -- joined_in -- 2004\nelon_musk -- joined_as -- chairman\nspacex -- founded_by -- elon_musk\nfalcon_9 -- used_for -- nasa\nspacex -- developed -- falcon_9\ndragon_spacecraft -- used_for -- nasa\nspacex -- developed -- dragon_spacecraft\ndragon_spacecraft -- used_for -- nasa\nfalcon_9 -- used_for -- nasa \n\n New Information: SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, developed the Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon spacecraft for NASA missions.", "output": "{\"name\": \"delete_graph_memory\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"source\\\": \\\"spacex\\\", \\\"relationship\\\": \\\"founded_by\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"elon_musk\\\"}\"}\n{\"name\": \"delete_graph_memory\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"source\\\": \\\"elon_musk\\\", \\\"relationship\\\": \\\"joined_in\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"2004\\\"}\"}\n{\"name\": \"delete_graph_memory\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"source\\\": \\\"spacex\\\", \\\"relationship\\\": \\\"developed\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"falcon_9\\\"}\"}\n{\"name\": \"delete_graph_memory\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"source\\\": \\\"spacex\\\", \\\"relationship\\\": \\\"developed\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"dragon_spacecraft\\\"}\"}", "session_id": "mem0_graph"}
